# This compose file is intended for cloud/remote hosts and pulls pre-built images from a registry.
# Usage (on the host where you want to deploy):
#   BACKEND_IMAGE=your/repo:tag FRONTEND_IMAGE=your/repo-frontend:tag docker compose -f docker_cloud/docker-compose.yml up -d
# You can override ports with BACKEND_PORT and FRONTEND_PORT environment variables.

# - Set ALLOWED_HOSTS and HOST via environment or an .env file when deploying to cloud.
# - For production behind a load balancer, consider running a reverse proxy (nginx/traefik) and securing TLS there.
